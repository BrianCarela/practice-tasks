      // obviously students won't use back ticks for string interpolation, they'll use ..."+"... for string concatenation. But if someone does, that's bonus points for Efficiency and Readability, imo. Readability can be argued that concatenation is easier tho
      console.log(`${i+1}${order} choice is ${color[i]}`);
